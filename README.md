# Mallory Sheehan's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This website reflects what I've learned during the Prework course for the UCLA Coding Bootcamp. I built this site to gain an understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Terminal, VS Code, and GitHub, as these are all things that I will be using in my day to day life as a future developer. Although it was hard, and took me many hours, and lots of research and trial and error, it was a great exercise to give me the too start this bootcamp!
