        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
          <li>The HEAD element contains information, or metadata, about the webpage that helps the browser to render the page correctly.</li>
          <li>The BODY element represents the visible content shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>The TITLE element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The STYLE element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The BASE element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The LINK element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The META element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The SCRIPT  element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Though some HTML elements are visible to users, others provide important information about an HTML document and website that is used by the browser so that the page renders correctly. These elements include the following: !DOCTYPE html, html, head, meta, title.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) - a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. Aka add style to our webpage</li>
      <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
      <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
      <li>INLINE CSS - When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
      <li>INLINE styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
      <li>INTERNAL STYLE SHEET contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
      <li>INTERNAL STYLE SHEET - a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
      <li>EXTERNAL CSS STYLE SHEET - allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. The most common way to style a webpage</li>
